To-Do List Web Application

Project Overview :
This project is a simple To-Do List web application where users can manage their tasks efficiently. 
The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
Tasks persist even after the page is reloaded, using the browser's LocalStorage for storage.

Features :
Add Tasks: Users can enter tasks in the input field and click the "Add" button to create a new task.
Edit Tasks: Users can modify an existing task by clicking the "Edit" button next to the task.
Delete Tasks: Tasks can be removed by clicking the "Delete" button next to the respective task.
Mark Complete: Tasks can be marked as complete by clicking the checkbox next to the task.
Persistent Data: The application uses LocalStorage to store tasks, so tasks are preserved even after refreshing the page.

Technologies Used :
HTML5: Structure of the web page.
CSS3: Styling and layout of the To-Do List.
JavaScript: Task management, including adding, editing, and deleting tasks, and handling LocalStorage for persistence.

How It Works :
Adding Tasks: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button. The task will appear in the list.
Editing Tasks: Click the "Edit" button next to any task. A prompt will appear allowing you to modify the task text.
Deleting Tasks: To remove a task, click the "Delete" button next to it.
Marking as Complete: Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as complete. Completed tasks are visually differentiated with a line-through effect.
Persistent Tasks: Tasks are saved to LocalStorage. Reloading the page will still display all previously added tasks
